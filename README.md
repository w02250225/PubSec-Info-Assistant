# Information Assistant Accelerator

This accelerator demonstrates a few approaches for creating ChatGPT-like experiences over your own data using the Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern. It uses Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo), and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval.

## Data Collection Notice

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described in the repository. There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with a copy of Microsoftâ€™s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

### About Data Collection

Data collection by the software in this repository is used by Microsoft solely to help justify the efforts of the teams who build and maintain this accelerator for our customers. It is your choice to leave this enabled, or to disable data collection.

Data collection is implemented by the presence of a tracking GUID in the environment variables at deployment time. The GUID is associated with each Azure resource deployed by the installation scripts. This GUID is used by Microsoft to track the Azure consumption this open source solution generates.

### How to Disable Data Collection

To disable data collection, follow the instructions in the [Configure ENV files](/docs/development_environment.md#configure-env-files) section for `ENABLE_CUSTOMER_USAGE_ATTRIBUTION` variable before deploying.

## Responsible AI

The Information Assistant (IA) Accelerator and Microsoft are committed to the advancement of AI driven by ethical principles that put people first.

## Getting Started

The IA Accelerator relies on multiple Azure services and has certain prerequisites that need to be met before deployment. It's essential to procure these prerequisites prior to proceeding with the deployment instructions in this guide.

---

## Prerequisites

To get started with the IA Accelerator you will need the following:
>
>* An azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service.
You can request access [here](https://aka.ms/oaiapply) *
>* Administrative rights on the Azure Subscription
>* [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
>
>
You can sign up for an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). 

Once you have your prerequisite items, please move on to the Deployment Configuration step.

**NOTICE:** * This codebase relies on the Azure OpenAI Service which must be procured first separately, subject to any applicable license agreement. Access to this code does not grant you a license or right to use Azure OpenAI Service.

The Information Assistant Accelerator requires access to one of the following Azure OpenAI models.

Model Name | Supported Versions
---|---
gpt-35-turbo | 0301, 0613
gpt-35-turbo-16k | N/A
**gpt-4** | N/A
gpt-4-32k | N/A

**Important:** It is recommended to use gpt-4 models to achieve the best results from the IA Accelerator. Access to gpt-4 requires approval which can be requested [here](https://aka.ms/oai/get-gpt4). If gpt-4 access is not available gpt-35-turbo (0613) is recommended.

## Deployment Configuration

The deployment process for the IA Accelerator, uses a concept of **Developing inside a Container** to containerize all the necessary pre-requisite component without requiring them to be installed on the local machine. The environment you will work in will be created using a development container, or dev container hosted on a virtual machine using GitHub Codespaces.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/PubSec-Info-Assistant)

Begin by setting up your own Codespace using our  [Developing in a Codespaces](docs/developing_in_a_codespaces.md) documentation.

*If you want to configure your local desktop for development container, follow our [Configuring your System for Development Containers](/docs/configure_local_dev_environment.md) guide. More information can be found at [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).*

Once you have the completed the setting up Codespaces, please move on to the Sizing Estimation step.

---

## Sizing Estimator

 The IA Accelerator needs to be sized appropriately based on your use case. Please review our [Sizing Estimator](./docs/costestimator.md) to help find the configuration that fits your needs.

Once you have completed the Sizing Estimator, please move on to the Deployment steps.

---

## Deployment

The following checklist will guide you through configuring the IA Accelerator in your azure subscription. Please follow the steps in the order they are provided as values from one step may be used in subsequent steps.

>1. Configure your deployment settings
>       * [Configuring your Development Environment](/docs/development_environment.md)
>1. Configure Azure resources
>       * [Configure Azure resources](/infra/README.md)

## Using IA Accelerator for the first time

Now that you have successfully deployed the IA Accelerator, you are ready to use the accelerator to process some data.

To use the IA Accelerator, you need to follow these steps:

> 1. Prepare your data and upload it to Azure.
>
>       * Your data must be in a specified format to be valid for processing. See our [supported document types in the Feature documentation](/docs/features/features.md#document-pre-processing).
>       * Upload your data [via the data upload user interface](/docs/features/features.md#uploading-documents).
> 2. Once uploaded the system will automatically process and make the document(s) available to you and other users of the deployment.
> 3. Begin [having conversations with your data](/docs/features/features.md#having-a-conversation-with-your-data) by selecting the appropriate interaction method.

For more detailed information review the [Features](/docs/features/features.md) section of the documentation.

docs/ | Deployment and other supporting documentation that is primarily linked to from the README.md
functions/ | The pipeline of Azure Functions that handle the document extraction and chunking as well as the custom CosmosDB logging.
infra/ | The BICEP scripts that deploy the entire IA Accelerator. The overall accelerator is orchestrated via the `main.bicep` file but most of the resource deployments are modularized under the **core** folder. 
pipelines/ | Azure DevOps pipelines that can be used to enable CI/CD deployments of the accelerator.
scripts/environments/ | Deployment configuration files. This is where all external configuration values will be set.
scripts/ | Supporting scripts that perform the various deployment tasks such as infrastructure deployment, Azure WebApp and Function deployments, building of the webapp and functions source code, etc. These scripts align to the available commands in the `Makefile`.
Makefile | Deployment command definitions and configurations. You can use `make help` to get more details on available commands.
README.md | Starting point for this repo. It covers overviews of the Accelerator, Responsible AI, Environment, Deployment, and Usage of the Accelerator.
