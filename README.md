## Getting Started

The IA Accelerator relies on multiple Azure services and has certain prerequisites that need to be met before deployment. It's essential to procure these prerequisites prior to proceeding with the deployment instructions in this guide.

---

## Prerequisites

To get started with the IA Accelerator you will need the following:
>
>* An azure subscription with access enabled for the Azure OpenAI service.
You can request access [here](https://aka.ms/oaiapply) *
>* Administrative rights on the Azure Subscription
>* [Visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
>
>
You can sign up for an Azure subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/). 

Once you have your prerequisite items, please move on to the Deployment Configuration step.

**NOTICE:** * This codebase relies on the Azure OpenAI Service which must be procured first separately, subject to any applicable license agreement. Access to this code does not grant you a license or right to use Azure OpenAI Service. 

---

## Deployment Configuration

The deployment process for the IA Accelerator, uses a concept of **Developing inside a Container** to containerize all the necessary pre-requisite component without requiring them to be installed on the local machine. The environment you will work in will be created using a development container, or dev container hosted on a virtual machine using GitHub Codespaces.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/PubSec-Info-Assistant)

Begin by setting up your own Codespace using our  [Developing in a Codespaces](docs/developing_in_a_codespaces.md) documentation.

*If you want to configure your local desktop for development container, follow our [Configuring your System for Development Containers](/docs/configure_local_dev_environment.md) guide. More information can be found at [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).*

Once you have the completed the setting up Codespaces, please move on to the Sizing Estimation step.

---

## Sizing Estimator

 The IA Accelerator needs to be sized appropriately based on your use case. Please review our [Sizing Estimator](./docs/costestimator.md) to help find the configuration that fits your needs.

Once you have completed the Sizing Estimator, please move on to the Deployment steps.

---

## Deployment

The following checklist will guide you through configuring the IA Accelerator in your azure subscription. Please follow the steps in the order they are provided as values from one step may be used in subsequent steps.

>1. Configure your deployment settings
>       * [Configuring your Development Environment](/docs/development_environment.md)
>1. Configure Azure resources
>       * [Configure Azure resources](/infra/README.md)

## Using IA Accelerator for the first time

Now that you have successfully deployed the IA Accelerator, you are ready to use the accelerator to process some data.

To use the IA Accelerator, you need to follow these steps:

> 1. Prepare your data and upload it to Azure.
>
>       * Your data must be in a specified format to be valid for processing. See our [supported document types in the Feature documentation](/docs/features/features.md#document-pre-processing).
>       * Upload your data [via the data upload user interface](/docs/features/features.md#uploading-documents).
> 2. Once uploaded the system will automatically process and make the document(s) available to you and other users of the deployment.
> 3. Begin [having conversations with your data](/docs/features/features.md#having-a-conversation-with-your-data) by selecting the appropriate interaction method.

For more detailed information review the [Features](/docs/features/features.md) section of the documentation.
