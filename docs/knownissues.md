## Error "Your adminstrator has configured the application infoasst_web_access_xxxxx to block users..."

By default Info Assistant deploys the webapp to require users to be a member of an Azure Active Directory Enterprise Application to access the website. If a user is not a member of the AAD EA they will receive this error:

### Solution

#### Option 1

Add the user to the Azure Active Directory Enterprise Application.

>1. Log into the Azure Portal
>2. Navigate to the App Service object in your resource group, named *infoasst-web-xxxxx*.
>3. View the **Authentication** tab. Select the "Identity Provider" link.

## Errors due to throttling or overloading Form Recognizer

Occasionally you will hit a 429 return code in the FileFormRecSubmissionPDF which indicates that you need to retry your submission later, or an internal error returned by Form Recognzer in the FileFormRecPollingPDF function, which indicates the service has hit internal capacity issues. Both of these situations will occur under heavy load, but the accelerator is deisgned to back off and retry at a later time, up to a maxmum set of retries, which is configurable. These values surface as configuration settinsg in the Azure function and can be revised there, or they can be updated at deployment in function.bicep, or they can be updated in the file local.settings.json which is used when debugging a function in VS Code. These values are as follows...

```
@description('The maximum number of seconds  between uploading a file and submitting it to FR')
param maxSecondsHideOnUpload string

@description('The maximum number of times a file can be resubmitted to FR due to throttling or internal FR capacity limitations')
param maxSubmitRequeueCount string

@description('the number of seconds that a message sleeps before we try to poll for FR completion')
param pollQueueSubmitBackoff string

@description('The number of seconds a message sleeps before trying to resubmit due to throttling request from FR')
param pdfSubmitQueueBackoff string

@description('max times we will retry the submission due to throttling or internal errors in FR')
param maxPollingRequeueCount string

@description('number of seconds to delay before trying to resubmit a doc to FR when it reported an internal error')
param submitRequeueHideSeconds string

@description('The number of seconds we will hide a message before trying to repoll due to FR still processing a file. This is the default value that escalates exponentially')
param pollingBackoff string

@description('The maximum number of times we will retry to read a full processed document from FR. Failures in read may be due to network issues downloading the large response')
param maxReadAttempts string
```

## Error : Error due to service unavailability

```
InvalidTemplateDeployment - The template deployment 'infoasst-myworkspace' is not valid according to the validation procedure. The tracking id is 'XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX'. See inner errors for details.
InsufficientQuota - The specified capacity '1' of account deployment is bigger than available capacity '0' for UsageName 'Tokens Per Minute (thousands) - GPT-35-Turbo'.
```
###Solution

This means that you have exceeded the quota assigned to your deployment for the GPT-35-Turbo model.The quota is the maximum number of tokens per minute (thousands) that you can use with this model. You can check your current quota and usage in the Azure portal. To increase the quota [learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits)

## Error:'OpenAI' is either invalid or unavailable in given region
```
InvalidTemplateDeployment - The template deployment 'infoasst-asbanger-vnext1' is not valid according to the validation procedure. The tracking id is '4c3fd9d0-59fb-47f3-aa5a-ddb13c9313e8'. See inner errors for details.
InvalidApiSetId - The account type 'OpenAI' is either invalid or unavailable in given region.
```
### Solution:
Deploy Azure OpenAI Service only in the supported regions. Review the local.env file and update the location as per supported models and [region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models#model-summary-table-and-region-availability)

## Error: jq parse error: Expected value before ','

If you see a jq parse error while doing deployments, it means one of the makefile scripts to extract environment variables is failing to find a value it expects to be there. The files related would be the main.parameters.json file which is the variables from bicep output from the infrastructure create. The other would be the env file used during build and deploy time

### Solution:
To resolve carefully check your deployment .env file for any missing but required values. There are rare times when ARM has issues and output values are not written. In which case simply double check your configuration and rerun the ```make deploy``` and/or ```make extract-env``` command so that the bicep outputs can be written again

## Error: Creation of new Media Service accounts are not allowed as the resource has been deprecated

### Solution:
Media Services is scheduled for 30th June 2024. This is the [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-services/latest/azure-media-services-retirement). On deeper investigation Video Indexer, which is the service we use that sits on top of Media Services, will switch away from this before the end date....

```
Is Azure Video Indexer being retired?
No, Azure Video Indexer isn't part of the Media Services retirement. Although Video Indexer currently relies on a Media Services account as part of its workflow, this dependency will be eliminated before Media Services is retired on June 30, 2024. See the following for more [impact of Media Services retirement for Video Indexer](https://aka.ms/vi-ams-retirement-announcement)
```

As of today, Video Indexer still requires a Media Services service to be created, and so we can't remove it from bicep deployment. We will need to assess closer to the date if VI is working without the service and we can then remove the dependency.

The error is interesting as it seems to indicate the media service cannot be created. This is not the case, it does work in regions where VI and Media Services are available. I have updated this to an enhancement and we will add a ticket to the board to action this when VI can be deployed without this supporting service.

## Error: Token limit often exceeded with PDF files

### Solution:

The root of this is table processing. If a table is greater than our target token count for a chunk, this is not respected.Essentially tables are not chunked, but treated as units. We have added a task to our board to split tables by chunk size and repeat the table header rows in each chunk..

When we switched to using unstructured.io for non-PDF documents, we were aware of the same issue there. They were planning on adding this feature. So, we need to make the change in our code, and follow up with unstructured to confirm if this has been fixed and update that path also.

This issue has been updated to an enhancement.
